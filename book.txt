Both wrap() and    () work by creating
a TextWrapper
instance and calling a single method on it.
That instance is not reused,
so for applications                      that wrap/fill many text strings, it will be more efficient
for you to
create your own TextWrapper object.Text is
preferably wrapped on
whitespaces and right after the hyphens in hyphenated words; only then will long words be broken if
necessary, unless TextWrapper.
break_long_words is set to false.
