Both wrap() and    () work by creating\n  \n   \n a TextWrapper \n instance and calling a single method on it.


	That instance is not reused,


        
	    so for applications       		 that wrap/fill many text strings, it will be more efficient for you to \n create your own TextWrapper object.Text is 

	    preferably wrapped on \n whitespaces and right after the hyphens in hyphenated words; only then will long words be broken if necessary, unless TextWrapper.	                       							    break_long_words is set to false.
